# **Modeling and Optimizing a Battery Charging Profile**

This is the work of _Marc Ajay Rajesh, Karthik Chennimalai Ganesh, Louise Marie Maganto, Atanacia Sanchez_ in applying our knowledge of electric circuits, energy transfers, and calculus to model charging behavior and evaulate efficiency in a Lithium Ion battery charging profile.
Our dataset comes from [dataset](Dataset/Lithium_Ion_Battery.pdf)


Within this project we 

## Model Battery Voltage Over time 
 comment: will link the code for each step as well as the image if applicable
## Fit the Voltage Curve

## Compute total energy delivered to the Battery

## Analyze the rate of voltage change at different intervals 

## Analyze the Energy lost due to resistence

## Introduce Temperature Effects into the model

## Compare Constant Current-Const Voltage (CC-CV)
