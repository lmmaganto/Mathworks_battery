# **Modeling and Optimizing a Battery Charging Profile**

This is the work of _Marc Ajay Rajesh, Karthik Chennimalai Ganesh, Louise Marie Maganto, Atanacia Sanchez_ in applying our knowledge of electric circuits, energy transfers, and calculus to model charging behavior and evaulate efficiency in a Lithium Ion battery charging profile.
Our dataset comes from [dataset] (https://www.ineltro.ch/media/downloads/SAAItem/45/45958/36e3e7f3-2049-4adb-a2a7-79c654d92915.pdf).


Within this project we 

## Model Battery Voltage Over time 

## Fit the Voltage Curve

## Compute total energy delivered to the Battery

## Analyze the rate of voltage change at different intervals 

## Analyze the Energy lost due to resistence
